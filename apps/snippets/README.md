## HyperlinkedModelSerializer

- [HyperlinkedModelSerializer](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#hyperlinkedmodelserializer)
  - By default hyperlinks are expected to correspond to a view name that matches the style '{model_name}-detail', and looks up the instance by a pk keyword argument.
- [Routers](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/#usage)
  - basename - The base to use for the URL names that are created. If unset the basename will be automatically generated based on the queryset attribute of the viewset, if it has one.
